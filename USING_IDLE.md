When IDLE is first opened, you have access to the [Python interpreter](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/interpreter.html).
That is, everything you type is exectuted a Python in an interactive environment. 
```
>>> x = 10
>>> print x
10
```

To open a file (Python script) do

**File --> Open**

To save a file do

**File --> Save** or just *Ctrl-s*

To run/execute the script do

**Run --> Run Module** or just *F5*

For most of this class we will be using IDLE as a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor): we will use it to actuall write and edit our code. 

IDLE, like most text editors, has a nice syntax highlighting feature that recognizes that we are writing Python and so highlights and formats words and phrases to draw a distinction between different parts of your code. 

IDLE is *not* a programming language and is not the same as Python. IDLE is similar to a word processor in that you can use it write whatever you want in any language if you wanted.
