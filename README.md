# Siena-College-CSIS-200
CSIS 200: Software Tools for Physicists. An introductory programming course for Physics and other Science majors. 

## Textbook
There is no required textbook for this class. 

However, you are strongly encourage to get a copy of [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/). There is a free, web-based version of the book, but you may benefit from having a hard copy for reference when you are working on homework and the projects. 

## Lectures

Below is a list of topics that we will be covering in class. *It is likely that we will not go through this list in chronological order!* Neither should you assume that each topic will take a week to cover. Some topics may take a lecture...or 1/2 a lecture. Some weeks we may go through 3 topics...or spend 2 weeks on one of these topics. 

The pace of the course will be dictated by how well the majority of the class is developing competency with the material. However, you should always feel free to plow ahead on your own! There are a ton of great [resources](https://github.com/mattbellis/Siena-College-CSIS-200/blob/master/RESOURCES.md) out there and you can always learn a lot from self-guided study.
