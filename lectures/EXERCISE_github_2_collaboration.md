In this exercise, you will use Github to collaborate on a project with one of your classmates. You will each work on different parts of a program, fix them, and then use Github to share your work. 

Let's get started!

# Set up a repository

You have been paired up with another classmate. You are now collaborators on a very important software project. Congrats!

One of you has been assigned the alias [Ada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace) and the other person has been assigned the alias [Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage). This is how I will refer to you for the remainder of this exercise. 

Ada will create a Github repository called

         class_grades

When Ada has created the repo, she will add Babbage as collaborator. To do this from the webpage, go to **Settings --> Collaborators** and add Babbage by using his Github account name. When this happens, Babbage should see this repo appear from their main Github page. 

Babbage will then edit the README.md through the web interface to give some description of the project.
