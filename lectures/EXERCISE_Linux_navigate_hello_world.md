Where are you?

Who are you?

    whoami

What files are in this directory?

    ls

Run the following command. This will download a tar archive (similar to a zip file), with directories and files in it. 

    wget https://goo.gl/Lcm2oR -O linux_files.tgz 

Unpack (actually untar) this file with the following command. 

    tar -zxf linux_files.tgz

Your assignment now is to:

* Run any python scripts you find. 
* Look inside any data files you find. 
* What is the full path to the data files?
* Where do I need to book travel to?
